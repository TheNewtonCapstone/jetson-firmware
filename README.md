# jetson-firmware
 This project creates a real-time control system that integrates machine learning with embedded processing for adaptive sensor and actuator control.

## Getting Started
1. Run the `start.sh` script using a bash shell. This will take a while when first pulling!
2. Run `docker compose exec newton bash` to jump into the shell of the running container. To exit, type `exit` while inside of Docker.
3. Run the `stop.sh` script to stop the container and remove it.
